# course-list

Interview project to show a course list selector

Regex. Wasn't working for a while. It was the surrounding slashes.

Testing the course input function. Parenthesis got me confused. Then initially used nested maps to get me the exhaustive list, but that just landed me with nested arrays, so I switched to nested forEach loops, appending to the "valid list" each stage
